= How to run Kakaotalk on Linux in 2020
:source-highlighter: rouge
:rouge-css: github

Thankfully, installing Kakaotalk has become much easier than before now that it's 64bit.

NOTE: As of 2021-07-08, unfortunately, there is a bug where if you have more than 2-3 lines of input in the chat window, Kakaotalk crashes.
I have no idea how to fix this, and it's pretty annoying.

== Preparation

For this, we'll need to install wine and playonlinux. This guide assumes you're using debian/ubuntu, but it should work the same for other distros.

[source,bash]
....
sudo apt install -y wine playonlinux
....

Next, download the PC version of https://www.kakaocorp.com/service/KakaoTalk?lang=en[Kakaotalk.exe].

== Install

Open `playonlinux` and click Install. (Kakaotalk will show up here once you've installed it).

Click `Install a non-listed program`.

Click through the initial prompts. Then select `Install a program in a new virtual drive`.

Give it a name with no spaces, such as `kakaotalk` or `kkt`.

Don't check any of these options, just click `Next`.

Select `64 bits windows installation` and wait a bit for the drive to be created.

WARNING: This step is important!

Select the `Kakaotalk.exe` file you downloaded earlier.

Continue through the Kakaotalk installation, just hit `Next` until the last prompt. Do not hit `Finish` before unselecting `Run KakaoTalk`.

WARNING: Make sure to unselect `Run KakoTalk` before proceeding.

Wait for playonlinux to scan the drive, then select `Kakaotalk.exe` for the shortcut. Give it whatever shortcut name you want, like `KakaoTalk`.

Now select `I don't want to make another shortcut`.

Kakaotalk is now installed! You should now see this screen:
