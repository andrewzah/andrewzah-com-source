= Automatically deploy your blog via Git with Caddy and Docker

NOTE: This is out of date. Caddy v2 -may- have a similar plugin, but I don't know of one to my knowledge. This article will be archived soon.

Over the years, I’ve incrementally optimized my blog. I used to use an
entire rails setup with postgres, because that was the first thing I
learned… Yet that’s quite the overkill for a blog with static content. I
don’t even include comments anymore. This is where
https://getzola.org[Zola] comes in, previously named _Gutenberg_. It’s a
static site generator written in Rust that uses
https://tera.netlify.com/[Tera] for templating. It serves as a
counterpart to https://gohugo.io/[Hugo], written in Golang. Both have a
similar featureset, so I chose Zola since I use Rust and can contribute
if needed.

However basically
https://git.sr.ht/~charles/cdaniels.net/tree/master/bin/buildit[any
static site generation system] can work, so long as you end up with
files generated to your liking.

== Zola

Feel free to skip this section if you already have your own static site
generation system.

*One caveat*: Zola minifies sass by default but not javascript. I use a
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/personal-site/tree/master/Makefile[Makefile]
to minify the js files and bundle them.

=== Getting started

Zola has a
https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/[getting
started] guide. For inspiration, you can look at the
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/personal-site/tree[source code for this
very blog] or
https://github.com/getzola/zola/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md[different sites
using Zola].\{\{fn(n=0)}}

=== My setup

This is what my site’s directory looks like:

....
.
├── binary-data/
├── Caddyfile
├── config.toml
├── content/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── public/
├── sass/
├── static/
├── syntaxes/
├── templates/
└── themes/
....

`binary-data` is where I store all the screenshots, pdfs, and other
binary data I refer to my posts. For the actual posts I upload these to
an amazon S3 bucket, but I keep these as a backup, _outside_ of
git.\{\{fn(n=1)}}

`sass/` and `static/` are pretty easy: the former gets compiled to css,
the latter gets copied directly to the `public/` directory during
generation.

For code, `themes` contains the syntax highlighting theme, and
`syntaxes` contains sublime syntax files I added because Zola doesn’t
support http://slim-lang.com/[slim] syntax highlighting yet.

This leaves us `content`, the actual posts and pages, and `templates`,
for how to render them. `templates` also contains `shortcodes/`, which
function much like wordpress’ shortcodes.

=== Templating

https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/personal-site/tree/master/templates[These]
are all the templates I’ve made. Naturally it can get as complex as you
want. I generally have one per page or page type, such as /projects or
/posts.

At a minimum, you probably want a
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/personal-site/tree/master/templates/base.html[base.html]
to deal with the oh-so-fun SEO stuff, and a `macros.html` for
``dynamically'' rendering things. I use it for the navigation bar,
footnotes, references, citations, and rendering links.

With child templates, you can use blocks to inject content back to the
parent:

[source,html]
----
<!-- base.html -->
<head>
  <!-- constants in base.html header -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

  <!-- set from child -->
  <title>{% block title %}{% endblock title %}</title>
  {% block head %}{% endblock head %}
</head>
----

then in the child you define the block:

[source,html]
----
<!-- zola provides objects like page/section/config, see the docs -->
{% block title %}{{ page.title }} | {{ config.title }}{% endblock title %}
----

Thrilling stuff.

If you look at my source it can appear a tad complex now, but I just
slowly added things as they came up– like the page title, then custom
SEO attributes, etc.

=== Macros

Tera’s macro system is really useful. One of my use cases was to show
the tags and categories below a post:

[source,html]
----
{% macro render_tags(tags) %}
  <div class="tags">
    Tags: 
    {% for tag in tags %}
      {% if loop.last %}
        <a href="/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/">{{ tag | title }}</a>
      {% else %}
        <a href="/tags/{{ tag | slugify }}/">{{ tag | title }}</a> | 
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
{% endmacro render_tags %}
----

Yes, I should probably clean them up a bit. They work good enough for
now.

=== Shortcodes

Shortcodes are awesome. Two main things I use them for:

* footnotes, citations, references
* generating boilerplate for lity.js (a lightbox lib)

[source,html]
----
<!-- img.html -->
<a href="{{url}}" data-lity data-lity-desc="{{desc}}" alt="{{desc}}">
  <img class="full" async-src="{{url}}"/>
</a>
{% if t %}
  <p class="image-desc"> {{t}} </p>
{% endif %}
----

[source,html]
----
<!-- fn.html -->
<a id="footnote-cite-{{num}}" href="#footnote-{{num}}">({{num}})</a>
----

My link:../korean-for-programmers/#finally-a-sentence[Korean for
Programmers] post uses ~5 shortcodes to
\{\{hl(t=``highlight'',c=``red'')}} words in different colors:

[source,html]
----
<!-- hlm.html -->
<!-- where t=text,c=css color class name-->
<span class="hl hl-middle hl-{{c}}">
  {{t}}
</span>
----

Okay, okay.. Time for the real stuff.

== Static Assets Repo

Now that you have your static files, commit them to a new git repo. With
Zola, I use `rsync` to move the output from `public/` to another
directory–since `zola build` nukes it each time.

As stated earlier I keep binary files like images in a separate
directory, and in the posts themselves I link to amazon s3. If you want
to link to assets locally, you might need something like
https://git-lfs.github.com/[Git LFS] from Github or or a different
solution.

I keep my statically generated assets at
https://github.com/azah/personal-site-public[github.com/azah/personal-site-public]
because sourcehut doesn’t support webhooks yet.

== Caddy

https://caddyserver.com/[Caddy] is an awesome HTTP/2 web server. It
handles SSL certs for you automatically via Lets Encrypt, and it has a
`git` plugin which we’ll be using. The git plugin clones or updates a
repo for us, so we can now push content to a git repo and have it
automatically update!

Let’s create the Caddyfile:

\{\{note(c=``Warning'', t=``Use a port (like :2015) for local testing
instead of the actual domain! If you run Caddy with this caddyfile
locally without the -disable-acme-auth, caddy will repeatedly try to
authorize, quickly ratelimiting you from Let’s Encrypt! You can also
use''tls off" to skip it entirely.") }}

....
# Caddyfile
yoursite.com, www.yoursite.com {
  gzip
  tls your@email.gtld

  cache {
    default_max_age 10m
  }

  git {
    hook /webhook {%SITE_WEBHOOK%}
    repo https://github.com/azah/personal-site-public.git
    branch master
    clone_args --recurse-submodules
    pull_args --recurse-submodules
    interval 86400
    hook_type github
  }

  root /www/public
}
....

The `SITE_WEBHOOK` environment variable is set in `.env`.

Note that a webhook is optional. In fact,
https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.git[all of the git directives here are
optional] besides the repo path itself. By default the plugin clones to
the root path, `/www/public` in this case.

I’ve set it to pull once per day as well as listen for requests on
`/webhook`. Right now I use github webhooks as `sourcehut` doesn’t seem
to support webhooks yet.

If you’re running multiple containerized services you can use caddy as a
proxy as well. You can see the
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/andrewzah.com/tree[source for
andrewzah.com’s docker script] as an example. I have an `http` docker
service that proxies to my `website` service, which looks like the
following:

....
# services/http/Caddyfile
www.andrewzah.com, andrewzah.com, andrei.blue {
  gzip
  tls zah@andrewzah.com

  log / stdout {combined}
  errors stderr

  proxy /webhook http://website:1111/webhook {
    transparent
  }

  proxy / http://website:1111
}

...
....

== Docker

Lastly, we’ll run all of this inside a docker container, so we need a
`Dockerfile`:

[source,docker]
----
FROM alpine:edge
LABEL caddy_version = "1.0.0" architecture="amd64"

# Caddy
RUN adduser -S caddy

ARG plugins=http.git,http.cache
ARG version=v1.0.0

RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-caddy openssh-client tar curl \
  && apk add --no-cache git \
  && curl --silent --show-error --fail --location \
  --header "Accept: application/tar+gzip, application/x-zip, application/octet-stream" -p \
  "https://caddyserver.com/download/linux/amd64?version=${version}&plugins=${plugins}&license=personal&telemetry=off" \
  | tar --no-same-owner -C /usr/bin -xz caddy \
  && chmod 0755 /usr/bin/caddy \
  && apk del --purge .build-caddy

RUN /usr/bin/caddy --plugins
RUN mkdir /www \
  && chown -R caddy /www

COPY Caddyfile /etc/Caddyfile

USER caddy
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/caddy"]
CMD ["--conf", "/etc/Caddyfile", "--log", "stdout", "-agree"]
----

and a corresponding `docker-compose` file:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.7'

services:
  web:
    restart: always
    build:
      context: .
    image: <your_dockerhub_username>/personal-site
    ports:
      - "1111"
    env_file:
      - ".env"
----

I try to use alpine docker whenever possible. This image fetches a
predefined Caddy version, v1.0.0, with the `cache` and `git` plugins.

We need to pass the `-agree` flag to agree to Let’s Encrypt’s Subscriber
Agreement. Caddy will not run otherwise unless you use
`-disable-http-challenge` (or specify http/a port), but we want HTTPS,
no?

Deploying the image is just `docker push` once you’ve signed in via the
docker cli.

'''''

…and that’s pretty much it. For your VPS, you’ll want to install docker
and/or docker-compose, then run the image. If you set up a corresponding
docker-compose file, you can do
`docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`.

If you’re using webhooks, don’t forget to configure the webhook on
github/gitlab/bitbucket/etc.

If configured correctly, you should now be able to git push your static
assets and automatically have the container pull them in!
