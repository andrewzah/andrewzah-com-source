My name is Andrew, but I also go by andrei, or zah. I entered this earth in 1996 in Chicago, or so I'm told.
I have two cats, named Peanut and Penelope.

== Background

In 2016, I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in Media Arts
and a cognate in Acoustic Engineering. I focused on documentary filmmaking and sound design.
Immediately after graduating I decided not to pursue a job in that industry.

At the end of 2014 I started teaching myself how to program here and there with ruby and rails.
Post-graduation I was looking for rails jobs to no avail, so I ended up teaching English in
South Korea in 2017. I've been studying Korean ever since then. On some days I can even speak it.

In 2018 I found a job with https://ossys.com[Open Source Systems] and have stayed there since.
I've had the opportunity to work on many projects, with all sorts of languages... particularly ruby, rust, golang, c#, and typescript.

Face it, you'll never be as cool these two.

== Ideologies
=== Programming
I generally try not to use proprietary software unless the open source alternatives *really* suck (such as film editors currently). That said, I don't mind paying for good software if it's not user hostile.

I am generally disgusted at the current state of web development. Modern web pages are severely bloated and collect an insane amount of personal data. Web developers update their old, fast, usable websites with buggy, slow, invasive, whitespace-heavy abominations. They optimize for ease of developing (on beefy computers and fiber internet...), not performance or user happiness. It's all very inconsiderate.

After using golang, I expect a formatting tool for any project I work on. I _hate_ wasting valuable brain resources on bikeshedding about formatting or manually formatting code.

=== Misc
Free Speech doesn't mean one is free of criticism or consequences.  However, I think people go too far sometimes,
sifting through decades of someone's writings to find something, anything to criticize.
This doesn't bother me so much as that other people then capitulate to these sorts of unjustified witch hunts that have little to do with improving the world.
I also find that overall approach to be almost completely punitative, with very little attempts at rehabilitation or addressing the underlying issues...
It really seems like a lot of people _enjoy_ the resulting drama.

In my opinion, in order to have a healthy society it is paramount that we allow discussion and debate with nuance.
Operating without context or nuance, just looking for soundbytes out of context, is just shameful.

Democracy is only really tenable when a non-trivial amount of citizens actually participate in the process.

== Contact

If you're contacting me about an issue for an open source project I work on,
creating a github issue is better.

Please ping me again if I don't respond in 1-2 weeks. I try to get back to people when possible.
