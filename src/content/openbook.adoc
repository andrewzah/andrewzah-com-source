Following the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sheet[Fakebook]
and
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Book[Real Book],
I wanted to make a successor that (1) addresses the issues found in both,
and (2) is buildable from source.

The following pdfs are auto-generated using
link:https://lilypond.org/[Lilypond], in Concert key and transposed for Eb and Bb.
