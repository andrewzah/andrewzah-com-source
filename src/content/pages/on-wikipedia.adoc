Wikipedia is generally alright for quick references or finding resources. However, one has to be *very* careful about any articles related to "soft" sciences or really any topics that are more subjective.

I do get why Wikipedia is the way it is. Without clear rules and tight moderation, it would quickly be flooded with junk articles and edits.
