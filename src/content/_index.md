## Standing Invitation

If you'd like to discuss something you think would be up my alley, my inbox
([zah@andrewzah.com](mailto:andrew@andrewzah.com)) is open.
In person, I'm open to a coffee if I'm not busy.
If you see me at some conference or meetup, absolutely come up and introduce yourself.

This was inspired by [patio11 / kalzumeus](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/).
