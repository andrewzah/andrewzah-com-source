I'm 28, a first generation Romanian-American, and currently live in Seoul.
I work for [Open Source Systems](https://www.ossys.com/) on [AnalyticsHQ](https://analyticshq.com/) and other projects.

I enjoy researching things and making useful apps for people.

## Standing Invitation

If you'd like to discuss something you think would be up my alley, my inbox
([zah@andrewzah.com](mailto:andrew@andrewzah.com)) is open.
I also enjoy reading articles if you have some to share.
In person, I'm open to a coffee if I'm not busy.

In general I love to learn new things and deeply discuss and pore over subjects. More specifically, I thoroughly enjoy:
- rust, nix, go, docker, and F/OSS software in general - especially software that improves the lives of humans instead of focusing on profit
- music (mainly jazz and blues but I like all genres), and learning an instrument + improvisation
- korean and studying languages
- street fighter 6/3s, and fighting games in general
- world history

If I don't get back, please understand that I'm likely busy, traveling, or simply forgot.
I try to get back in a reasonable timeframe, but life happens.

My current city is Seoul, and I visit nearby countries from time to time.
I typically announce my trips on
twitter ([@jazzolologist](https://twitter.com/jazzolologist))
and bluesky ([@abare.party](https://bsky.app/profile/abare.party)).
Note that I disable notifications on my phone for these, so don't expect a timely response.

If you see me at some conference or meetup, absolutely come up and introduce yourself.
