= Building a Home Server with FreeNAS
:toc:

NOTE: After this article was written, FreeNAS was rebranded to TrueNAS.

A few months ago I got gripped with server fever. I’d had a raspberry pi
for a while, but I could never find a meaningful use for it. I’d tried
running plex, etc, but the pi3 would choke after a bit and sputter out.

One day I decided enough was enough: it was time to build a more beefy
server. (and I found a compelling use for the pi!)

== My Goals

I had a few goals I wanted to achieve:

1.  be relatively future-proof
2.  host a plex server
3.  be able to spin up multiple VMs for various reasons like testing
ansible scripts
4.  potentially host games for me and my brother

If all you want to do is host Plex/jellyfish, a raspberry pi should
suffice. As long as your media isn’t hvec x265. Before I built this
server I had two 2tb drives plugged into my raspberry pi, and other
content was fine for the most part.

== The Requirements

I don’t have space in my home for a rack for a server, due to both the
size and noise. That immediately eliminated a lot of build paths that I
saw.

The ideal spot for the server was my living room, so I needed a
relatively low profile server- and a _quiet_ one.

The remaining requirements were:

* at least 8 hard drive bays
* a relatively modern/beefy cpu
* low(er) power consumption

I felt like 8 drives (+1 or 2 ssds) was enough for future expansion,
even with RAID-10 taken into account. I went with a mirrored structure
so I could replace drives without heavy rebuild times, and so I could
easily expand the pool if necessary. I started with 6 drives, so I have
a zpool with 3 vdevs of 2 drives each.

=== Part List

What I thought was going to be a relatively simple task turned into a
huge amount of research… I spent most of my time on
https://www.ixsystems.com/community/[iXsystems’ community forum] and
https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/[/r/homelab] on reddit. The people on
iXsystems’ forum were very helpful and detailed. However, most of the
information for iXsystems is based around used intel boards. Much less
material is available if you’re like me and are interested in newer AMD
cpus.

So how did I narrow it down? I did what I always do: make a spreadsheet.
There are simply way too many options presented to figure what cpu/mobo
to choose without spreadsheet analysis. Without further ado:

The total comes out to around $632. I don’t know why anyone would build
a server without getting some sort of UPS/APC as well.

The total was $676 for these parts, with $291 for the memory alone. DDR4
ram with ecc isn’t cheap. For comparison, a Xeon E5-2650 V2 goes for
around $70 on ebay, with significantly cheaper DDR3 ram.

NOTE: I’ve used the ryzen setup for 3+ months now with no issues.

'''''

So I was already at $1,300, _before_ purchasing hard drives. I bought 6
Western Digital Red 4TB drives initially, @ $100. Later on I got 2 more
drives, and another stick of ram.

Altogether, it was $1300 for the parts + $800 for the drives, or ~$2100
in total.

I didn’t go with a used intel board because of the higher power usage
and less powerful specs. This made my build much more expensive, but
also more future proof.

=== Usage

I adapted my jail setup and structure from
https://gist.github.com/mow4cash/e2fd4991bd2b787ca407a355d134b0ff[this
gist], and installed rancheros via
https://github.com/redshift-s/rancheros-docker-media[this guide].

I currently have 20 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail[jails]
running, and 5 docker containers running in
https://rancher.com/rancher-os/[RancherOS] (which
https://www.ixsystems.com/documentation/freenas/11.2-U7/virtualmachines.html[runs
in a VM] with 2 cpus and 4GB memory).

Why jails over docker? Convenience, I guess. It’s far easier for me to
muck around in iocage jails than it is to inspect and debug docker
containers. Unfortunately this does mean if I lose my server, I’d have
to recreate all those jails… but setting them up in the first place was
pretty easy once I learned how
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc.d&sektion=8&n=1[rc.d]
worked.

Services that I run:

....
backblaze
  -> data backup
bazarr
  -> grabs subtitles in multiple languages, hooks into radarr/sonarr
caddy
  -> reverse proxy to some of these services
calendar
  -> radicale
kitana
  -> ui for plex plugins
mailbackup
  -> offlineimap + cron
node_exporter
  -> feeds into prometheus on the raspberry pi
paperless
  -> digital document store
plex
  -> media catalogue + streaming
radarr
  -> monitors local shows for for bazarr subtitle grabbing
sonarr
  -> monitors local movies for for bazarr subtitle grabbing
syncthing
  -> seamlessly sync files between computers
thelounge
  -> modern irc client. I used to use znc+weechat, but I got
     tired of weechat's ux. thelounge is simple and pretty.
....

....
postgres
mysql
....

Several services use databases, so I elected to set aside jails for
them.

....
mc_main
mc_creative
mc_survival
....

I also run 3 instances of minecraft via https://papermc.io/[PaperMC], a
high performance fork of https://www.spigotmc.org/[Spigot]. The main
jail runs https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall[Waterfall] (a fork of
https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord[bungeecord]) along with a hub
instance. Waterfall acts as a proxy and lets one access multiple servers
within a network.

My docker services:

....
andrewzah/gollum
  -> a wiki with changes automatically git pushed
  -> a fork of gollum with user logins
insekticid/docker-piwiki (matomo)
  -> self-hosted analytics (tracking andrewzah.com)
  -> respects requests to not track user
radhifadlillah/shiori
  -> self-hosted website backup, similar to archive.web
huginn/huginn
  -> self-hosted, more powerful version of IFTTT
cwspear/docker-local-persist-volume-plugin
  -> allows local volume mounts in portainer/rancheros
portainer/portainer
....

=== A Use for the Raspberry Pi

Once I built the server, I had no use for my raspberry pi3 and 4. Until
I learned about https://prometheus.io/[prometheus] and
https://grafana.com/[grafana].

Having metrics and a dashboard is awesome, but if my server crashes, I
no longer have access to the metrics… So they have to be run somewhere
else! This is where the raspberry pi comes in- it just sits on my local
network ingesting traffic.

Unfortunately, node_exporter doesn’t seem to export hdd temperature
values, which is pretty important. I’ll probably have to write a simple
script to pull those values and host another metrics target for
prometheus.

==== Why FreeNAS?

FreeNAS has extensive documentation. and *BSDs are nice. ZFS and RAID
are nice. Free Software is nice.

If I didn’t use docker so heavily I would likely use FreeBSD or OpenBSD
for my personal computers as well instead of Debian.

'''''

Overall the process of building a server was pretty fun, but I’m glad
I’m done with that for the foreseeable future. I didn’t self-host that
much when I began, but once I started adding services I started thinking
about everything I could self host.
