= Things to avoid with Anki

There are some common mistakes people make when getting into flash cards
and spaced repetition for the first time. Considering that Anki is
generally used for years, correcting bad habits ends up paying large
dividends.

For those unaware, https://apps.ankiweb.net/[Anki] is a free app that
implements
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#active-recall-testing[active
recall] with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition[spaced
repetition]. If you’re new to Anki, the very first thing I recommend
doing is https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html[reading the manual],
or at least https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#the-basics[the
basics].

So with that said, let’s get into it!

== Not doing Anki daily

If you take away only one tip from this post, let it be this one.
Nothing else here matters if you don’t consistently review cards daily.

The entire point of Anki is spaced repetition. Every time you skip a
day’s reviews, the following session will become more difficult. For
non-mature words (less than 30 day intervals) it’s crucial that you
review. If you don’t review for a long time, you will soon have hundreds
of reviews stacked up, which is super demotivating.

I used to do Anki before bed, but this sometimes led to me skipping it
due to work, friends, or life just taking up more time and energy than
expected. Now I consistently do anki either in the morning after I’ve
fully woken up, or around lunch.

If you change your study time, make sure to update your Anki
Preferences, under Basic > `Next day starts at`. This tip goes hand in
hand with the next one.

== Mixing reviews and new words

This is Anki’s default behavior. I personally recommend against this as
sometimes you don’t have the time or energy in a day to sit down and
learn the new cards. It’s okay if you don’t learn new words, but missing
reviews is really bad.

But you can’t only do the reviews, since they’re mixed in with the new
cards! So guess what ends up happening? Both the reviews and new cards
get skipped…

By changing Anki preferences to `Show new cards after reviews`, you can
always do reviews without worry. After you wake up, while you commute,
et cetera.

== Having too many concepts per card

A good anki card should have **one** concept. Avoid memorizing lists if possible.
If you do have to memorize a list, turn it into an
enumeration (1. 2. 3…). It's much better to make split concepts into multiple cards.

When memorizing foreign words it’s really tempting to put every
definition into one card. Don’t do this. Putting related definitions
together is fine, but if a word has multiple different meanings, it
needs different cards.

I see this a lot in premade decks, with 1 card having 4 or 5 totally
unrelated usages of a word–and no sentence samples either, of course.


== Studying too many new words

Don't go over 20 words per day unless you are studying *at least* 1-2 hours
every day. Initially it's doable but if you miss a day or two, it piles up so
fast it’s scary.

If you do 20 words a day, every day, for a year, you will learn 7,300
words. That is pretty darn good! For most, if not all, languages, 3-5k
words will let you have basic conversations.

Don't understimate the power of slow and steady practice.

== Only using premade decks

If you’re a beginner to studying a language, using a premade deck is
fine due to the sheer amount of time it takes to add words to a deck.
However the longer you study, the more you need your own personal deck.

If you use someone else’s deck, it’s basically a random collection of
words that you lack the context for. For your own personal deck you have
to see the word somewhere first, giving you more of a feeling for the
context.

If you’re trying to mass-memorize words (say, for a language test), I
recommend using Anki’s
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#decks[parent/subdecks
feature]. That way you can use a premade deck _and_ your personal deck
at the same time. Spiffy.

I explain subdecks a bit more in my
link:../better-anki-usage-guide-2019#utilizing-subdecks[Better Anki
Usage] post.


== Not making use of reverse cards

If you always have your native language on the front, and target language on the back,
then you're training yourself to think in your language, then recall the equivalent in your target language...
If you always have your target language on the front, and your native language on the back,
then you're training recognition more than recall...

I don't know which way is better. (Please send research if you do know).
*But* I do know that Anki supports automatically making decks with both options!

You can also make automatically make cards that go both ways if you use
the `Basic (and reversed card)` template. So adding a card with [library,
la biblioteca] will make another card that’s [la biblioteca, library]. If you only want
-some- cards to have a reverse, you can use the provided
`Basic (optional reversed card)` template. This one only makes a reverse
if you put something in the `Add Reverse` field (it can be any input, it
doesn’t show anywhere).

See https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#reverse-cards[the manual]
for more information on reverse cards.

== Not including sample sentences

A lot of language learning decks just have the word and its translation.
For very basic words this can be fine, but for most words you really do
need sample sentences so you can see the context as well.

I include 3 sample sentences in all the cards I make, as well as notes,
common word pairings, and the grammar type.

== Pressing `easy' too easily

It’s can be tempting to give a review card the `Easy' grade, quickly
giving it large intervals. Don’t do this unless you know the word quite
well (in which case, why even have the card at all?). Otherwise the
interval will increase rapidly, and you’ll have forgotten it by then.

Actually, due to how Anki works, pressing `Easy` (or `Hard`)
_permanently_ modifies that card, giving it way longer intervals than
what it should be. I go over this in detail in my
link:../better-anki-usage-guide-2019#why-behavior-changing-plugins-are-needed[Better
Anki Usage] post. Almost all long-term Anki users that I talk to do not
press `Easy` often, or ever.

== Not syncing all the time

You should always sync after every session, especially if you edit
anything.

Did you know `y` is the sync shortcut?

== Not memorizing keyboard shortcuts

Last but not least, learning a few shortcuts is useful since Anki is
used so much.

When reviewing a card:

* undo -> ctrl/cmd-z
* Spacebar => Flip the card
* 1,2,3,4 => The numbers follow the order of the grading buttons. So for
a review, which has `Again`, `Hard`, `Good`, `Easy`, those are 1,2,3,4
respectively. A new card has `Again`, `Good`, `Easy` by default, which
are 1, 2, 3.
* e => edit card

Other shortcuts:

* r => replay audio
* @ => suspend a card
* m => mark a card (adds a `marked` tag so you can find it easily later)
* ctrl or cmd-1,2,3,4 => flag a card with red, orange, green, or blue,
respectively
* - => bury a card (hide it until tomorrow)

Window/tool shortcuts:

* y => sync
* d => go to decks overview
* b => browse cards
* a => add card
* t => stats
* / => custom study session
* f => create filter deck

Overkill, you say? Well.. yeah, probably. Aside from spacebar, 1,2,3,4,
r, and y, you don’t really need to know the rest unless you like being
super duper efficient.

== Conclusion

These are some of the problems I’ve encountered while using Anki. Are
there other ones you think I should talk about? Let me know.
