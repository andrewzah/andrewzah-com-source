Hi! My name is Andrew, and I work remotely as a software developer. I’ve
worked while traveling across America with spotty or no internet
connection. I’ve worked in countries like South Korea and Japan. I like
traveling, and this is how I stay productive.

== Development Machine

Before we begin, why apple and osx?

1.  battery life
2.  _battery life_
3.  weight
4.  unix-like environment

and to an extent, some proprietary or osx-only apps: photoshop,
premiere, affinity designer, and sketch.

Before you scoff, I used freebsd and arch on my home pc as daily
drivers. I used a modded thinkpad t430 for a few months as
well. <<tmg>> I put in an i7-3632QM (quadcore) chip, a quieter
heatsink, 2x8gb memory, a t420 old-style keyboard, and a 9 cell battery.

It was sweet… before I started lugging it around.

Weight-wise it was slightly heavier than my 15" macbook (~4.5lbs?), and
the battery life made it unusable. I was getting 4-5 hours, max, and
occasionally it would just die earlier than expected. (Forcing me to go
reset the system time in BIOS).

I was always worried about my power source. I
link:/posts/2019/living-out-of-2-backpacks-6-month-retrospective/[have lived out of two backpacks]
and worked remotely while traveling, so I
can’t rely on always being next to an outlet. My 2015 13" macbook pro’s
battery is still good to the point that I can get 6-7 hours out of it
while working with Rust/C#. It’s more like 8-9 if I’m only doing light
writing, etc.

I know someone’s going to respond with "but oh, you should’ve just used
power++ with x, y, z configurations!". I _did_ experiment with
different settings with power++ and other alternative tools–nothing
seemed to help. Call me a grumpy old man but I want to work and get
things done… not fiddle about with battery tuning settings and the like.

Eventually I’ll need to replace this mac. All post-2015 macbooks have
been undesirable to me so I’ll probably go with a dell xps 13", or maybe
a System76 Galago. I just want a durable machine with an excellent
battery that’ll work years later and won’t have me configuring things
constantly. Is that too much to ask?

'''''

At home I do have an x201 and x220 thinkpad however. They’re great for
testing different operating systems, etc. I just don’t like traveling
with them. The x201 is quite small so hopefully it’ll become my main
writing machine.

== Configuring OSX & Tools

The first thing I always do is install xcode-tools, iTerm2, brew, and
zsh. Then I clone the osx branch of my
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree[dotfiles repo] and symlink
the files where they need to be. I should automate this part with a
script, but making that script would take me far more more time than
just doing it manually. Not worth it, for now at least.

You can use `brew leaves` to see installed items and `brew cask list`
for cask items. I
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/brew-leaves[stored]
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/cask-list[mine] when I
originally started abstracting out my dotfiles.

=== poor man’s window tiling

After using i3 I can’t go back to non-tiling window managers. I long for
the day that i3 works natively on osx. Sigh.

I’ve somewhat replicated it with
https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm/[chunkwm],
https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd[skhd], and
https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner[karabiner]. Chunkwm is a tiling
window manager, but it doesn’t handle keyboard input. That’s where skhd
comes in. I copy/pasted to my
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/.khdrc[khdrc] but to be
honest I don’t use most of these hotkeys still.

Then, I use karabiner to make my right command key into a hyper key– it
presses shift, command, control, and option.

==== cons

Some applications have minimum window sizes. So if I have too many
windows in one workspace, they will just overlap. Spotify and KakaoTalk
are example offenders.

=== poor man’s workspaces

I use 10 Spaces. I added shortcuts to quickly focus them: hyper + 1-5,
w-y.

I disable "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use",
in Settings -> Mission Control. This has got to be one of the worst
defaults ever made.

My workspaces generally follow this order:

1.  terminal (currently iterm2)
2.  browser (firefox)
3.  misc / Rider / Safari
4.  misc
5.  misc
6.  [w] misc / desktop / vlc / signal
7.  [e] misc / discord
8.  [r] kakaotalk, messages app
9.  [t] anki
10. [y] thunderbird

Something about the Catalina update broke `hyper + q`.

=== apps

I almost always have iterm2, firefox, kakaotalk, anki, and thunderbird
running.

Misc tools I generally use:

* DB Browser for SQLite
* Insomnia (REST api testing)
* Azure Data Studio (ms-sql querying)
* Datagrip (reading stored procedures / db schemas)

Task bar apps:

* Harvest (time tracking)
* Duet (to use my ipad as an extra display)
* Caffeine (prevent my computer from sleeping)

And non programming-related ones:

* Discord (messaging, language study, rss)
* KakaoTalk (messaging)
* Line (messaging)
* Signal (messaging)
* Anki (flash card study)

=== code editor

For non-C# code, I use neovim, vim, or vi, in that order. I don’t really
care what you use. I like (neo)vim, so I use that. I just become
disappointed when people reflexively dismiss it (or Emacs) because they
have any learning curve, like at all. There’s a _reason_ why vim has
one, and it’s not because Bram Moolenaar is particularly masochistic. In
particular, modal editing and buffers <<buf>> are why I enjoy
vim.

Even if you don’t use vim, I urge you to read the manuals of the
software that you do use. Small tidbits of knowledge add up over time,
especially with common repetitive actions.

It’s also good to know a little `vi` when you mess up your FreeBSD
installation and have to dip into an emergency shell. Will `nano` be
accessible then?

_Modern Vim_ by Drew Neil is a fantastic read. I read parts of it here
and there to glean ways I can improve my vim usage. Every vim user
should read _Oil and vinegar - split windows and the project drawer_
http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/[from
vimcasts].

'''''

You can see my
https://git.sr.ht/~andrewzah/dotfiles/tree/osx/config/nvim/init.vim[neovim
configuration here] here, although I need to prune it a bit. The biggest
changes I’ve made are:

* mapping jj to escape from insert mode, or otherwise using ctrl-[
otherwise to avoid repetitive strain from hitting escape
* using https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] +
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf.vim] to fuzzy search through my
files.
* using https://github.com/w0rp/ale[ale] to asynchronously lint and fix
files (but only on file save. I hate over-eager tools that complain when
I’m halfway through writing code)
* using https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[plug] to manage plugins and
lazily-load them
* disabling vim’s annoying swapfile system.

Oh, and https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox[gruvbox], possibly one of the
best color schemes ever made. Every once in a while I experiment with a
different scheme but I inevitably get drawn back to the king. If someone
made https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord[Nord] but with green as the
main color instead of blue, I might use that.

==== cons

Vim’s autocompletion… exists I guess. A while ago I looked into it but
it seemed not worth the hassle to set up. Anyway, ctrl-p in `insert`
mode brings up suggestions from open buffers. Good thing `p` is right
next to `[`, which takes you out of `insert` mode. /s

As an aside, did you know that `vim` displays
`Type :quit<Enter> to exit Vim` if you hit ctrl-c, and that it’s done so
for a long time? Is your joke very outdated and unoriginal? Yes, yes it
is.

=== code editor (for C#)

I use https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/[IntelliJ Rider] on both osx and
arch. I think the value is worth it. It’s definitely nowhere near as
snappy as vim but doing C# without autocompletions would eb… rough. The
build profiles and test runners are pretty nice. Modifying environment
variables and profile configurations is tedious.

The Intellij plugin ecosystem is great- you can easily install plugins
in any of their editors, to my knowledge. There’s even an official
https://intellij-rust.github.io/[rust plugin].

However, cmd-4 is the shortcut to close tabs..?! The default controls
are interesting, to put it one way.

== Workflow

=== tasks

Everything starts and ends with meetings and slack. I work on different
projects for clients and my team has a daily 5-30min call at 9am (10pm
in Korea).

In Slack and our meetings we’ll discuss what needs to be done. I or
others will make bullet points of the most pertinent stuff that needs to
be done. No agile or anything,
https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html[thank
god]. We previously used a few different ticket tracking systems and
I’ve found that they all suck.
https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/[YouTrack] sucks, but it was better
than the proprietary abomination one of our clients made us use. The
only good system I’ve found is:

1.  make a list (or queue, if you prefer it that way) of things
2.  roughly ballpark estimates, with the understanding that estimating
things is notoriously difficult
3.  accurately prioritize those things (if everything is #1/urgent,
nothing is)
4.  work on those things
5.  discuss progress and blockers in daily call and/or slack
6.  repeat

That’s it.

On top of this, issues in github/gitlab/etc are also pretty good if you
come up with good labels. Right now I’m experimenting with Github’s
Projects and semi-automated issues on our newest project.

'''''

Being 13 hours ahead does pose issues occasionally, but I solved this by
going to sleep a bit later (about 1am or so). Having different things to
work on is also important– if I’m ever blocked on something, such as
waiting for a teammate to wake up and answer a question, I can just work
on something else in the meantime. This async style of work won’t work
if you always need rapid communication with your team.

=== logging my thoughts

The http://notational.net/[Notational Velocity] application massively improved the quality of my life.
At its core, the idea is deceivingly simple.

[quote, National Velocity]
____
NOTIONAL VELOCITY is an application that *stores and retrieves notes*.

It is an attempt to loosen the mental blockages to recording information
and to scrape away the tartar of convention that handicaps its
retrieval.

You store text in notes. There is only one search box–if a file doesn’t
exist for your search string, one will automatically be created.
____

I began to use it for just about everything, since any and all
information I had written down could now be easily searched through and
found.

* seldom-used vim tidbits
* miscellaneous knowledge about real languages (I study Korean)
* random snippets for programming languages (how do I open a file in
ruby again?)
* tentative to-do lists
* niche, detailed information like serial numbers and specs for
equipment that I bought

It was glorious. Except… it was, and still is, mac only. At home I use
*nix systems or windows, so using it became tedious and I eventually
stopped.

As I was writing this article, I discovered
https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/[nVALT]–Brett Terpstra’s fork.
It has more functionality like markdown support and a better interface.
No vim keybindings though, which made it unpleasant for me to use.
Terpstra is working on
https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/10/codename-nvultra/[nvUltra]
currently which may fix this.

After I started writing this article, Alex Singh released
https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim[notational-fzf-vim], which is
basically notational velocity but in vim! As the name implies, fulltext
searching is powered by https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf], which in
turn uses https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep[ripgrep] by default.
Both are excellent tools I use daily.

The preview window is amazing..!

In order to use it, you need to specify at least one directory for the
plugin to search. This will be the primary directory where new notes
will be saved, but you can search multiple directories.

[source,vim]
----
" notational fzf vim
let g:nv_search_paths =
  \ ['~/Desktop/Sync/thoughts',
    \ '~/Desktop/Sync/thoughts/korean',
  \]

and some example files that I’ve written to this week:

....
packing-list.md
self-publishing.md
useful-shell-scripts.md
vim.md
watches.md
youtube-videos.md
korean/colloquial-or-slang.md
korean/color-names.md
korean/clothes-verbs.md
....

== Conclusion

This is my personal setup. I find it fascinaing to look at other
people’s workflows and see how they handle things. Usually I can take
away a thing or two and improve my own workflow. Feel free to make
suggestions.
