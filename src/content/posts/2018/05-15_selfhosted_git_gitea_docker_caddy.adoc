= Selfhosting git with Gitea, Docker, Caddy

Something I’ve been doing recently is starting to self-host as much as I
can. I don’t like relying on businesses, since they can change their
services on a whim. I host an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC[IRC
network bouncer], a https://github.com/miniflux/miniflux[feed reader],
and so on. But why not a git frontend?

It also doesn’t make sense to me that __Git__hub isn’t open-source,
despite being a company built on _git_—libre software that powers the
programming industry. Gitlab is commendable for actually being open
source[[1]], but it’s fairly heavy in resource usage and it has a lot of
features I don’t really need.

So in comes https://gitea.io/en-US/[Gitea], a community fork of
https://gogs.io/[Gogs], which is written in go-lang and is quite
lightweight. More importantly, it can mirror with both Github and
Gitlab, giving us data redundancy. Let’s get into it!

## Prerequisites

`docker` and `docker-compose` need to be installed on your system. In
this case, I’m running it with a bunch of other services on a
https://www.hetzner.de/[hetzner.de] Cloud VPS for €5/month. You could
probably run it on their €2.50/month plan. (2GB vs 4GB of RAM)

## Docker-Compose: Part 1

In this case, both Gogs and Gitea provide premade docker images for us.
Handy! Thankfully they’re mindful about docker image size, with
https://hub.docker.com/r/gitea/gitea/tags/[Gitea 1.4] clocking in at a
mere `34MB`.

This means all we have to do is create a `docker-compose` file:

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3.3"

services:
  git:
    image: gitea/gitea:latest
    ports:
      - "3000"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/git
        target: /data
    restart: always
----

This file defines `git` as a service, using the mentioned gitea image.
You can use `latest` or keep it at a specific version, it’s up to you.

Next, Gitea runs on port `3000` by default, so we need to expose the
docker container’s port likewise. Note that we are _not_ doing
`3000:3000`, which would have the port exposed externally. Instead, we
have a tool that’ll handle the routing for us.

### Caddy

https://caddyserver.com/[Caddy] is an `HTTP/2` webserver. Its killer
feature is automatically handling https://caddyserver.com/[HTTPS with
Let’s Encrypt]. Seriously, I cannot recommend it enough for personal
projects. Gone are the days of manually handling certificates and using
https://www.nginx.com/[nginx]. link:#Footnoes[[2]]

Caddy’s `Caddyfile` syntax is fairly simple:

[source,caddyfile]
----
git.andrewzah.com {
  tls your@email.com

  log / stdout {combined}
  errors stderr

  proxy / http://git:3000
}
----

Here, we’re giving instructions for the domain `git.andrewzah.com`. The
`TLS` directive configures HTTPS connections, and providing an email
means Caddy won’t prompt us.

The `log` and `errors` directives are self explanatory.

`proxy` is what we’re really interested in. It lets us pass the
connection to the local gitea container we just created, on port `3000`.

## Docker-Compose: Part 2

In order to run Caddy, we need to add it as a service:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  http:
    build:
      context: github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker.git
      args:
        version: 0.10.11
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/sites/
        target: /var/www/sites/
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/caddypath/
        target: /var/caddy/
      - type: bind
        source: ./Caddyfile
        target: /etc/Caddyfile
    environment:
      CADDYPATH: "/var/caddy"
    env_file: ./secret.env
    ports:
      - "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443:443"
      - "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80:80"
    restart: always
----

Again, a docker image is provided for us thanks to `abiosoft`. We can
specify which caddy version and any caddy plugins if desired. Since
we’re not running a dns or net server, we don’t have to worry about much
configuration.

`data/sites/` and `/data/caddypath` store information related to Caddy
and the automatically generated Let’s Encrypt files. `/etc/Caddyfile` is
where Caddy looks, so we bind our caddyfile there.

`env_file: ./secret.env` is only needed if a caddy plugin requires
sensitive data, such as the `tls.dns.gandiv5` plugin.

Replace the port IP with your server’s IP. The reason we use that is
because by default, `yyy:zzz` will listen on _all_ interfaces.

## Docker-Compose: Part 3

You may have noticed by now that we’re missing one big thing… a
database. This one is simple, because Gitea is smart and runs on
Postgres:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  git_db:
    image: postgres:9.6.7-alpine
    env_file:
      - ./secret.env
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/postgres/
        target: /var/lib/postgresql/data/
----

In `secret.env`, you’ll need to set the following:

....
POSTGRES_USER=xxxx
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yyyyyy
POSTGRES_DB=git
....

Now that we have a database service, we can add this to the `gitea`
service:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  git:
    depends_on:
      - git_db
----

## Editing SSHD

There’s one problem now, which is that if you actually try to run this
configuration, you’ll be refused. We never actually exposed ssh’s
default port `22`, nor did we start listening to it!

So let’s listen to `22` for git, and `2223` for regular ssh. Edit, with
sudo permissions, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

....
# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
Port 2223
Port 22
....

At this time, I would also recommend disabling password login, as one
can never have enough security. Just make sure you add your
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/[ssh
key] output to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`! You’ll be locked out otherwise.

....
PermitRootLogin without-password
PasswordAuthentication no
....

## Docker-Compose: Final

Lastly, now that we’re listening on port `22`, add this to the
`docker-compose.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  git:
    image: gitea/gitea:latest
    ports:
      - "22:22"
----

Now when we do `git push origin master`, with `origin` set to
`https://git.andrewzah.com/...`, it’ll reach the gitea container!

In total, it should look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3.3"

services:
  git:
    image: gitea/gitea:latest
    ports:
      - "3000"
      - "22:22"
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/git
        target: /data
    restart: always

  git_db:
    image: postgres:9.6.7-alpine
    env_file:
      - ./secret.env"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/postgres/
        target: /var/lib/postgresql/data/

  http:
    build:
      context: github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker.git
      args:
        version: 0.10.12
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/sites/
        target: /var/www/sites/
      - type: bind
        source: ./data/caddypath/
        target: /var/caddy/
      - type: bind
        source: ./Caddyfile
        target: /etc/Caddyfile
    environment:
      CADDYPATH: "/var/caddy"
    env_file: ./secret.env
    ports:
      - "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:443:443"
      - "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80:80"
    restart: always
----

## Conclusion

If everything was done correctly, you should now have a self-hosted git
frontend. Nice!

I recommend checking out
https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted[awesome-selfhosted] to
see a huge list of other software you can host.
https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/[reddit.com/r/selfhosted] is also a
good resource. The possibilities are endless… You could host a
https://github.com/wekan/wekan[Kanban board] or a
https://cockatrice.github.io/[Magic: The Gathering Cockatrice server]!

If you start hosting multiple services, it makes more sense to break
them out into separate folders, with `http` being its own central
service. You can check out my
https://git.andrewzah.com/andrei/andrewzah.com[services repository] to
get an idea.
