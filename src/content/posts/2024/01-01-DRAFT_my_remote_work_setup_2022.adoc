= My remote work setup for 2022
:toc:
:sectnums:
:figure-caption!:

It's time for my next installment of my workflow series.
See my previous one https://andrewzah.com/posts/2019/my-setup-remote-programming-osx-2019/[for 2019].

I work as a software engineer for https://ossys.com[Open Source Systems],
primarily on our https://analyticshq.com[AnalyticsHQ data platform].
I was the first employee and we've worked fully remotely since I joined in early 2018.
I work on our backend and microservices, and dockerize applications for AnalyticsHQ.

== Development Machine

My main requirements are: be powerful, have 32+ gb of memory, and be relatively light.

I primarily work off of my Dell XPS 13 9300, provided by my company.
I find a 12-13" display is more than sufficient, and it keeps the weight down.
If you walk around a fair bit, weight seriously adds up quickly.

I take my framework along as a backup, but I don't use it much due to the battery life.
Unfortunately the XPS isn't too much better;
I usually get about 3-4 hours of heavy development in before it starts throttling heavily.

At home this isn't a problem, but short battery life means I need to plan around power sources instead of randomly choosing a cafe to work at. I've been contemplating on going back to apple with the M2 Macbook Pro, but... I've been using linux daily for more than 5 years now and I'm used to it. Plus, I want https://frame.work[Framework] to succeed!

== Workflow

In i3 I have 10 workspaces set up. `Alt+1` changes my display to workspace 1, and so on. `Alt+Shift+1` moves the currently highlighted window to that workspace. This is generally how I use them:

* Workspace 1 -> Terminals, typically 2 split vertically
* Workspace 2 -> Web browser, sometimes with a terminal
* Workspace 3 -> Email (Thunderbird)
* Workspace 4 -> Misc.
* Workspace 5 -> Slack/Terminal
* Workspace 6-9 -> Misc.
* Workspace 10 -> Social (Element/Discord/Telegram chats)

To focus on one window, I change the mode in i3 from tabbed to stacked.

.conf
[,conf]
----
# toggling view types
bindsym $mod+s layout stacking
bindsym $mod+p layout toggle split
----

I can also sub-divide by telling i3 to open the next program horizontally or vertically, relative to the currently highlighted window.

.conf
[,conf]
----
# splits
bindsym $mod+o split h
bindsym $mod+v split v
----

And anything that can run in the background lives in a tmux session.
I frequently rename tmux sessions with
kbd:[CTRL-B + $].

== Software

General applications:

* Firefox (daily use) / Chrome (Testing)
* Zoom / Microsoft Teams
* Slack / Element / Telegram / Discord
* Vaultwarden / Bitwarden
* Thunderbird
* Scrot / Maim / Feh / Grim+Slurp (Wayland)

and development stuff:

* Ansible
* Docker
* https://skarnet.org/software/s6/[S6] <- for managing services in a docker container
* Kubernetes Lens
* https://github.com/casey/just[Just] (instead of Make)
* Apache Directory Studio <- For working with LDAP

=== Distro Setup

I prefer a minimal linux setup, only consisting of i3 and rofi. Fedora 36 came with gnome out of the box, but I found it just annoyed me and wasted CPU cycles + storage on stuff I didn't care about. I originally ran Wayland but Zoom kept on crashing when I tried to screenshare.

I would be running Arch, but I'm working on some stuff related to FIPS-140-2 and Fedora supports enabling FIPS mode easily.

=== Editor

Neovim. Learning to use a modal editor by far is one of the things I'm most grateful for.

For Rust / C# / Java I'll use JetBrains products, like CLion / Rider / Intellij IDEA, respectively, with the vim and gruvbox plugins. The app itself is not that important, but once you learn to edit modally, editing non-modally becomes excruciating.

If you do edit with vim (or emacs/etc), I **highly** recommend setting up fuzzy search with https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] and not using a tree explorer like nerdtree. See: http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/[__Oil and vinegar - split windows and the project drawer__].

I spend a lot of time in docker images and ssh'ing into systems, so I'm grateful that `vi` is just about always present.

=== Terminal
My journey has been xterm -> iterm2 -> kitty -> alacritty -> foot -> xterm.

I love xterm because it's plain and boring. It just does the terminal stuff, and it's __very__ fast.
I don't need my terminal to worry about things like tabs as I can do that with tmux + i3.

Sorry `st` (suckless terminal), I'm not applying a git patch and recompiling my damn terminal to change configs. Should be named "suck more terminal" or "xterm, but massively worse terminal". Less lines of code is not automatically better.

On Wayland/Sway, https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot[Foot] terminal is nice.
