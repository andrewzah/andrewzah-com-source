= Leverless controllers: Perhaps not what was envisioned?

Today marks about 14 months since I first started using a leverless controller,
...and the first week of playing with a traditional joystick. I've fallen out of love with leverless style controllers for a few reasons.

== A bit of history

Before that though, Let's backtrack a bit. On June 2nd, 2023, SF6 (Street Fighter 6) was released worldwide.
The first big tournament was

link:https://liquipedia.net/fighters/MenaRD[MenaRD] being crowned champion.

I hadn't played fighting games competitively in years (I originally played Super Smash Brothers: Melee),
but watching players like
link:https://liquipedia.net/fighters/NuckleDu[NuckleDu],
link:https://liquipedia.net/fighters/Punk[Punk],
and MenaRD duke it out with the breathtaking new visuals of SF6 was exhilarating!

NuckleDu in particular inspired me to pick up Guile.
Immediately I ran into the question of which input method to use:
pad (a PS5 controller), or stick (a traditional joystick). I hadn't heard of leverless at this point.

I did try the

and the
link:https://thearcadestick.com/qanba-obsidian-2/[Qanba Obsidian 2],
but joysticks feel quite alien if you're not already accustomed to them from arcades (which I never went to as a kid).
So I stuck with the PS5 controller's d-pad style inputs, even if it felt frustrating at times.
After all, NuckleDu and Punk play with pads. So surely it must be possible for me, too.

Then I attended

in August and laid my eyes upon the curiosity that is

I mean, look at it! It's so tiny! You mean to tell me I can get the more comfortable layout of joysticks,
*without* having to lug one around all day at a tournament?? And lots of people are using them?

So of course, I immediately bought one. I shifted to it once I got home and never looked back.
I always hated using d-pads for fighting game inputs, so good riddance.

I kept on playing, and hit Master rank before taking a break.

== What is a "Leverless" controller?
Succintly, it's a joystick controller, minus the joystick lever, which is replaced with buttons for cardinal directions.
People also commonly refer to these by the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark[generic trademark]
"hitboxes", coming from the popularity of the
link:https://www.hitboxarcade.com/products/hit-box[Hit Box by Hit Box Arcade].

There are two main styles: WASD layout, or thumb jump layout, for lack of a standard term.

== So why switch now?
There are a few major reasons.

* Preventative Health: Tendon Strain
* Leverless unreliability
* Leverless' insane prices

== Preventative Health: Tendon Strain
Leverless' are usually touted as "more ergonomic" and "less straining", which is something I take issue with.

In fighting games, quarter circles are very common. Take the iconic Hadouken input:
kbd:[{sym_darr}] kbd:[{sym_drarr}] kbd:[{sym_rarr}] kbd:[Punch].

This is pretty easy on Player 1 side since you input it with your index and middle fingers.
On Player 2 side though, you now use your middle finger and the much weaker ring finger.
This is compounded with the typical "quarter circle x2" Super input:
kbd:[{sym_darr}] kbd:[{sym_drarr}] kbd:[{sym_rarr}]
kbd:[{sym_darr}] kbd:[{sym_drarr}] kbd:[{sym_rarr}]
kbd:[Punch / Kick].

Depending the game, half circles are also common. For example, a Super input in Guilty Gear Strive:
kbd:[{sym_rarr}] kbd:[{sym_drarr}] kbd:[{sym_darr}] kbd:[{sym_dlarr}] kbd:[{sym_larr}] kbd:[{sym_neutral}] kbd:[{sym_rarr}] kbd:[Heavy Slash]

Looking at these, there is physically no way a leverless can be less strain on your tendons.
On pad you slide your thumb or rotate the stick. On joystick you rotate the stick.
On leverless, you have to physically press those inputs with your index, middle, and ring finger...

The downside of both leverless and joysticks is they encourage wrist planting.
I've experienced strain when playing with one in my lap (as opposed to on my desk)
if I don't remember to keep my wrists suspended.
