= Why and How I acquired a Korean Resident Card

Once you have a Korean visa, getting a Resident Card is fairly straightforward.

NOTE: The Resident Card (RC) was previously known as the Alien Registration Card (ARC).
Amusingly the Korean text hasn't changed, it still says 외국인, meaning "foreigner".

== Why: The Benefits
The reason I applied for the F-1-D visa in the first place was the ability to get a resident card.
Without one, staying longterm in South Korea is an exercise in frustration.

Want to buy something online from a Korean company?
You'll need a Korean bank credit/debit card unless they happen to accept foreign cards.

Want to make a reservation at a restaurant? Catchtable requires a Korean bank account and phone number.

Want to make a reservation using Naver or use Naver Pay?
You need to verify with a Korean phone number, and prepaid ones don't work.

In short, you get these benefits and more:

* a Korean bank account and debit card
* a real phone number that works with verification services
* access to Korean-based services like Catchtable and all of Naver's services
* a link:https://en.namu.wiki/w/%ED%86%B5%EA%B4%80%EA%B3%A0%EC%9C%A0%EB%B6%80%ED%98%B8?from=%EA%B0%9C%EC%9D%B8%ED%86%B5%EA%B4%80%EA%B3%A0%EC%9C%A0%EB%B6%80%ED%98%B8[personal customs code]
in case you want to buy and import things from foreign companies

== How

* First, acquire a valid long-term visa (greater than 90 days).
* Visit link:https://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do[immigration.go.kr] and schedule an appointment.
* Prepare the necessary documents for your visit.
* Go to the immigration office and pay the fee for either the pickup or mail option.
* Wait for your resident card to arrive via mail or pick it up on the scheduled date.

=== Necessary Documents
* A physical, valid 3.5x4.5mm picture. Search 사진관 in Naver Maps to find one near you that offers official portraits. Don't be alarmed if they do some photoshopping.
* A photocopy of your passport.
* A photocopy of a Proof of Residence. I used a copy of the contract I signed with Local Stitch.
* A filled out application form. You can do this ahead of time or fill it out at the immigration office.
* **Exactly** 34,000 KRW for the mail option, or 30,000 KRW for the pickup option.

TIP: I recommend doing the pickup option. It's cheaper, and you know exactly when to come back to pick it up.
The mail option will be sent out whenever it's completed, and you must be there to sign for it.
